"""Retarded"" disparages the differently abled. Don\'t be that guy",Antagonizing,Not Hateful,Constructive,Disagree,">New immigrants tend to cluster, but their kids tend to mingle.   The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority. The percentage of marriages is actually not that impressive when you compare it to the disproportionate rise in non-whites. It would be a valid argument if the demographics stayed the same. As it stands, 1 in 10 married people being interracially married is actually a really poor number.  >And despite the propaganda spread around here and Fox News, immigrants tend to commit less crime than native-born  Depends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position.  >communities with higher immigration levels tend to have less crime overall.   Not necessarily, poor Jews commit way less crime than poor Blacks. We can find all sorts of exceptions. Rich Arabs and Muslims tend to amplify their backwards and regressive views, money has little to do with it. If that were the case, Saudi Arabia wouldn't be the World's Richest Hellhole.  >Those pesky facts: guess diversity really is strength.   Once again, you people don't actually understand the points being raised by the Right. When immigration control is right - like it was in Canada until just recently - immigration is a net benefit. Again, *literally zero conservatives say otherwise.* Canada has one of the most restrictive immigration programs on the planet. The United States had the same. The United States, and Donald Trump, have never once claimed immigration is bad. Never once. What they say is unchecked and unvetted immigration is bad. And it is. This is the problem with Mexico. By the way, Mexico agrees with this which is why it is so restrictive with Guatemala. Donald Trump wants to make America's immigration policy more like Canada's.  Diversity *for the sake of diversity* is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how *on a genetic level* they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism.   Here's a spoiler for how this is going to go, though: once you codify these racial differences, you will be able to chart them based on higher value and lower value. You cannot say ""this is different"" without also assigning a relative value to it. Once you do that, we will be able to have a conversation about which immigrants are *better* than others.

The actual production company that makes the movies is [Dead Gentlemen Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Gentlemen_Productions).  I think. The exact nature of how the two companies are related doesn't seem to be entirely clear (that I can find with some casual Googling).  What *is* clear is that in the last few films, the content that they produce has started to take on SJW overtones. I know some people here [didn't like the last Gamers movie](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6ws40a/had_to_stop_watching_the_gamers_hands_of_fate/) because of perceived SJW-isms, something that I [disagreed with](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6ws40a/had_to_stop_watching_the_gamers_hands_of_fate/dmadvol/) at the time.  Unfortunately, it's gotten worse since then. ""Gamers Zero"" and ""The Gamers: The Shadow Menace"" (the former being a collection of shorts, leading into the latter film) went full-retard in their support for social justice. Several points include:  * Magellan, a wizard who comes to Earth from the fantasy world of Fartherall (and promptly gives himself amnesia), unconsciously uses his magic to influence events in the 21st century. These include his causing the housing crash of 2008, coining the ""ethics in game journalism"" line, and encouraging Trump to run for President.  * A new group of gamers includes an openly gay fat guy, who objects strongly to playing Rogar as being straight, despite Rogar being an existing character who is firmly established as being heterosexual.

Women can feel this, but can't understand it. See, the world needs both feminine and masculine energy. Masculine energy is risk-taking, conquering, competitive.

Because it's a bitch move.  &#x200B;  Having said that, feminists are attempting to bring gender equality by being more masculine. See, this is where women always fuck up.

"Please refrain from referring to people as ""Retarted"". It insults persons who are dealing with real issues.",Antagonizing,Not Hateful,Constructive,Disagree,"Of course we do.  >In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase ""politically correct"" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, The New York Times reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits ""only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct.""[2]  >As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided ""correct"" positions on all political matters.   That is the history and that is how it is implemented today. Regardless of attempts to ~~redefine~~ mask the function, that is what it is at root.  Over-reaching collective orthodoxy is *always* a problem, always oppressive.  Doesn't really matter if the garnish is religious or ""secular"", it's still saturated in emotional beliefs rather than objective facts, and that's why it is described as pseudo-religion.  It follows the same social mechanics, the fervor, the ostracization of non-believers, the denial of objective facts for the purposes of The Party, the substitution of science with rationalizations, the same manipulations of brow beating or guilt-tripping or other forms of shaming.  This is one end of [PC culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUPsGDFZzVM) as an example of how bad it can get. *Abject* science denialism, rejecting dissent with manipulations according to PC ""rules"".  If science is ""oppressive"" then your views are not in line with reality whatsoever.  Admittedly, a lot of these people are marginalized.  It's just not for the reasons they claim(skin, genitals, etc).  It is because they are pants on head retarded.  It's that they think being ""politically correct"" has any basis in reality over being *factually correct.*  For this reason, there are some times when marginalization is called for.  Same reason we marginalize other stupid ideas or ideologies which have the end result of being objectively bad for society(the intent is irrelevant).  Why is intent irrelevant?  Because good intent often has ridiculously bad results.  Contrary to what these mental midgets learned in early life, it's not just ""the thought that counts"".  It's the *impact*.  There's nothing but good intent behind most anti-vaxxers.  They don't set out to breath new life into virtually extinct diseases, but it is a very real potential impact of their suggested plan.  Nobody really thinks they're the bad guy( barring socipaths/psychopahs and the like, as well as some epiphany about how they've made stupid decisions that got them into the situation they're in...Why?  these are statistical outliers).  ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people that he didn't exist"" bears some merit in this case, and I say this even as an atheist.  People too unintelligent to know they're a danger to themselves and others, or those that know and successfully hide it behind platitudes and lip-service that sounds good to a casual observer...  ""Political correctness"" is one such term, as is ""Social Justice"" and a wide variety of language of leftist orthodoxy buzzwords.

But just telling at people just demonstrates that she's a complete cunt and an utter chav ho. Unfortunately, its not illegal to be a classless twat.

If she doesn't know, why is she there?

It takes a serious case of sexism to presume that a woman who has had multiple sex partners, knows how to flirt, goes on dates unchaperoned, and knows how to seduce has absolutely *no idea* what a man wants to do when she's alone with him in a private place.  Are women really *that stupid* that they can't even understand this?

Also, don't buy into the narrative that ""the previous waves are ok"" - they were all an example of movements with good intentions that had bad results and extremely bad actions.  They got some of what they wanted but a lot of shitty things happened to society to get to where they wanted.  For example, you can thank the suffragettes for winning the women's vote, but also forgetting to require women to enroll in the selected service *to* vote and get student aid, meanwhile ALL MALES are required to do so.  Oh by the way, all rich property owners before the suffragette movement started were allowed to vote, INCLUDING WOMEN.  The suffragette movement didn't fight for the rights of lower class or black women to vote either, just those of the bourgeois and upper class - does that fucking sound familiar to you?  Also the suffragettes were *very* violent back then.  Some of them behaved like the anti-fa of today.  (I had to sift through the first page of left wing news sites APOLOGIZING for suffragette terrorism.  Bugs the shit out of me that I have to pull up conservatives but hey, I never said I was a left winger, just a CENTER-left winger)  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-5377051/PETER-HITCHENS-Suffragettes-terrorists.html  https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/heroines-no-the-suffragettes-were-terrorists-plain-and-simple/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3GQK_9gjMQ  Last channel is a real cool guy, MGTOW but not the ""women should lose the right to vote"" type.

Orwell‚Äôs Animal Farm   By 2018, the reading and writing classes were becoming so easy since language had been surreptitiously reduced to less difficult words through political correctness that the animals were free to think openly as much as they could because really, nobody could think.¬† Many large words were memorized even though the ability and comprehension of such words were becoming more troublesome.¬† Big words yes, complete sentences no.   As for the commie pigs, they could still read and write perfectly and were able to guide the rest of the animals and help them think progressively. The lawyer dogs learned to read and memorize very well, as they wanted to make sure they followed the plan of the pigs because obviously they knew best. They knew how to keep their fellow animal inmates secure in the courtyard and focused on their task at hand.¬† Muriel, the doctor goat, could read better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap. Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but he was too caught up in watching sports to really exercise his faculty. So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading when there was a good game on. Clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put together a complete sentence. Boxer could not get beyond the letter D.¬† He would trace A,B,C,D, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding.¬† On several occasions, indeed, he did learn E,F,G,H, but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten A,B,C, and D. Finally he decided to be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once or twice every day to refresh his memory. Mollie refused to learn any but the six letters which spelt her own name. She would form these very neatly out of pieces of twig, and would decorate them with a flower or two and walk around them admiring them.   None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A. It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks, were unable to learn the basics of complete knowledge, terms such as Tax Cuts for the Rich, Troll, Russia interfered into the election and Trump is liar and believe these items without the ability to state a single fact about any of them, because facts are obviously irrevelant when you cannot comprehend them. After much thought, Snowball the pig declared that the basics knowledge could be reduced to a single maxim, namely: ‚ÄúTrump is a liar.‚Äù This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism. Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences.
