If however you were to grab anyone from other parts of a western country the results would be decidedly different and I feel pretty confident in stating that. What you see on social media and mainstream television especially is skewed incredibly towards middle/upper class people and they live in an absolute bubble. I honestly believe some of them are the medieval equivalent of nobility and are just completely out of touch with the rest of the country.  You grab somebody from Yorkshire for example who actually has to produce things and work for a living it's a completely different type of person. I think technology is just a convenient scapegoat, much easier to blame that than admit you have a problem with incredibly out of touch people who don't even realise where their food comes from or how the smartphones they use got made.  I'm not even sure I want to necessarily go there because I think most normal people do realise the work it takes to make civilisation and *gasp* use social media to find out about it all. It's just these useless cunts that have a completely disproportional influence on media that don't.  I say this because channels like how to make everything and primitive technology are very popular, I really like primitive technology because it does absolutely everything from scratch which is very handy if you ever find yourself in a survival situation.

reddit_2508,e7zf91n,"Each of the waves of feminism has made them essentially the ""SJW""s of their time, including the suffragettes, who were the precursor to feminism.  Also, don't buy into the narrative that ""the previous waves are ok"" - they were all an example of movements with good intentions that had bad results and extremely bad actions.  They got some of what they wanted but a lot of shitty things happened to society to get to where they wanted.  For example, you can thank the suffragettes for winning the women's vote, but also forgetting to require women to enroll in the selected service *to* vote and get student aid, meanwhile ALL MALES are required to do so.  Oh by the way, all rich property owners before the suffragette movement started were allowed to vote, INCLUDING WOMEN.  The suffragette movement didn't fight for the rights of lower class or black women to vote either, just those of the bourgeois and upper class - does that fucking sound familiar to you?  Also the suffragettes were *very* violent back then.  Some of them behaved like the anti-fa of today.  (I had to sift through the first page of left wing news sites APOLOGIZING for suffragette terrorism.  Bugs the shit out of me that I have to pull up conservatives but hey, I never said I was a left winger, just a CENTER-left winger)  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-5377051/PETER-HITCHENS-Suffragettes-terrorists.html  https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/heroines-no-the-suffragettes-were-terrorists-plain-and-simple/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3GQK_9gjMQ  Last channel is a real cool guy, MGTOW but not the ""women should lose the right to vote"" type.  Anyway, what's going to annoy me is after Gen-Z grows up with its conservative/libertarian pushback of all this retarded socjus stuff, maybe 20-30 years from now we'll probably deal with another wave of this retardation, and I can't imagine how much more retarded that wave is going to be after this wave.

reddit_2249,e96idzz,">New immigrants tend to cluster, but their kids tend to mingle.   The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority. The percentage of marriages is actually not that impressive when you compare it to the disproportionate rise in non-whites. It would be a valid argument if the demographics stayed the same. As it stands, 1 in 10 married people being interracially married is actually a really poor number.  >And despite the propaganda spread around here and Fox News, immigrants tend to commit less crime than native-born  Depends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position.  >communities with higher immigration levels tend to have less crime overall.   Not necessarily, poor Jews commit way less crime than poor Blacks. We can find all sorts of exceptions. Rich Arabs and Muslims tend to amplify their backwards and regressive views, money has little to do with it. If that were the case, Saudi Arabia wouldn't be the World's Richest Hellhole.  >Those pesky facts: guess diversity really is strength.   Once again, you people don't actually understand the points being raised by the Right. When immigration control is right - like it was in Canada until just recently - immigration is a net benefit. Again, *literally zero conservatives say otherwise.* Canada has one of the most restrictive immigration programs on the planet. The United States had the same. The United States, and Donald Trump, have never once claimed immigration is bad. Never once. What they say is unchecked and unvetted immigration is bad. And it is. This is the problem with Mexico. By the way, Mexico agrees with this which is why it is so restrictive with Guatemala. Donald Trump wants to make America's immigration policy more like Canada's.  Diversity *for the sake of diversity* is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how *on a genetic level* they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism.   Here's a spoiler for how this is going to go, though: once you codify these racial differences, you will be able to chart them based on higher value and lower value. You cannot say ""this is different"" without also assigning a relative value to it. Once you do that, we will be able to have a conversation about which immigrants are *better* than others.

The actual production company that makes the movies is [Dead Gentlemen Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Gentlemen_Productions).  I think. The exact nature of how the two companies are related doesn't seem to be entirely clear (that I can find with some casual Googling).  What *is* clear is that in the last few films, the content that they produce has started to take on SJW overtones. I know some people here [didn't like the last Gamers movie](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6ws40a/had_to_stop_watching_the_gamers_hands_of_fate/) because of perceived SJW-isms, something that I [disagreed with](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6ws40a/had_to_stop_watching_the_gamers_hands_of_fate/dmadvol/) at the time.  Unfortunately, it's gotten worse since then. ""Gamers Zero"" and ""The Gamers: The Shadow Menace"" (the former being a collection of shorts, leading into the latter film) went full-retard in their support for social justice. Several points include:  * Magellan, a wizard who comes to Earth from the fantasy world of Fartherall (and promptly gives himself amnesia), unconsciously uses his magic to influence events in the 21st century. These include his causing the housing crash of 2008, coining the ""ethics in game journalism"" line, and encouraging Trump to run for President.  * A new group of gamers includes an openly gay fat guy, who objects strongly to playing Rogar as being straight, despite Rogar being an existing character who is firmly established as being heterosexual. This results in Rogar seducing two male guards during a heist.  * An Asian female member of that new group angrily objects to a comment someone else makes that she thinks is ""casual misogyny"" (I can't remember what the comment was).  * A black guy in the new group is implied to have had a recent encounter with racist members of law enforcement. Because of this, he has Nimble (a white character) openly say (when he meets some enemies during a nighttime encounter) ""Greetings, fellow white people! Isn't it grand that I, as a white man, can encounter you here at night and *not* have my presence be construed as inherently threatening?""  * Another member of that group, a white girl who is implied to be a lesbian, gets upset at the idea of The Shadow (the campaign's ultimate enemy) having kidnapped a princess, remarking that the trope was old when Super Mario Bros. did it, and that the princess should rescue herself. (She then has egg all over her face when she's told that ""Princess"" is the name of the five year-old daughter of another member of her party.)  In short, the newest productions in the ongoing Gamers/JourneyQuest series (the two series share the same universe) seem to be going full socjus.

Orwell‚Äôs Animal Farm   By 2018, the reading and writing classes were becoming so easy since language had been surreptitiously reduced to less difficult words through political correctness that the animals were free to think openly as much as they could because really, nobody could think.¬† Many large words were memorized even though the ability and comprehension of such words were becoming more troublesome.¬† Big words yes, complete sentences no.   As for the commie pigs, they could still read and write perfectly and were able to guide the rest of the animals and help them think progressively. The lawyer dogs learned to read and memorize very well, as they wanted to make sure they followed the plan of the pigs because obviously they knew best. They knew how to keep their fellow animal inmates secure in the courtyard and focused on their task at hand.¬† Muriel, the doctor goat, could read better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap. Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but he was too caught up in watching sports to really exercise his faculty. So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading when there was a good game on. Clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put together a complete sentence. Boxer could not get beyond the letter D.¬† He would trace A,B,C,D, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding.¬† On several occasions, indeed, he did learn E,F,G,H, but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten A,B,C, and D. Finally he decided to be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once or twice every day to refresh his memory. Mollie refused to learn any but the six letters which spelt her own name. She would form these very neatly out of pieces of twig, and would decorate them with a flower or two and walk around them admiring them.   None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A. It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks, were unable to learn the basics of complete knowledge, terms such as Tax Cuts for the Rich, Troll, Russia interfered into the election and Trump is liar and believe these items without the ability to state a single fact about any of them, because facts are obviously irrevelant when you cannot comprehend them. After much thought, Snowball the pig declared that the basics knowledge could be reduced to a single maxim, namely: ‚ÄúTrump is a liar.‚Äù This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism. Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences. The birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that Trump could not be lying about everything, but Snowball proved to them that this was not so.","People have their own opinions, just try not to be offensive/unreasonable please.",Antagonizing,Hateful,Not Constructive,Disagree,Antagonizing,Not Hateful,Constructive

reddit_2887,e7jms2n,"Of course we do.  >In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase ""politically correct"" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, The New York Times reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits ""only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct.""[2]  >As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided ""correct"" positions on all political matters.   That is the history and that is how it is implemented today. Regardless of attempts to ~~redefine~~ mask the function, that is what it is at root.  Over-reaching collective orthodoxy is *always* a problem, always oppressive.  Doesn't really matter if the garnish is religious or ""secular"", it's still saturated in emotional beliefs rather than objective facts, and that's why it is described as pseudo-religion.  It follows the same social mechanics, the fervor, the ostracization of non-believers, the denial of objective facts for the purposes of The Party, the substitution of science with rationalizations, the same manipulations of brow beating or guilt-tripping or other forms of shaming.  This is one end of [PC culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUPsGDFZzVM) as an example of how bad it can get. *Abject* science denialism, rejecting dissent with manipulations according to PC ""rules"".  If science is ""oppressive"" then your views are not in line with reality whatsoever.  Admittedly, a lot of these people are marginalized.  It's just not for the reasons they claim(skin, genitals, etc).  It is because they are pants on head retarded.  It's that they think being ""politically correct"" has any basis in reality over being *factually correct.*  For this reason, there are some times when marginalization is called for.  Same reason we marginalize other stupid ideas or ideologies which have the end result of being objectively bad for society(the intent is irrelevant).  Why is intent irrelevant?  Because good intent often has ridiculously bad results.  Contrary to what these mental midgets learned in early life, it's not just ""the thought that counts"".  It's the *impact*.  There's nothing but good intent behind most anti-vaxxers.  They don't set out to breath new life into virtually extinct diseases, but it is a very real potential impact of their suggested plan.  Nobody really thinks they're the bad guy( barring socipaths/psychopahs and the like, as well as some epiphany about how they've made stupid decisions that got them into the situation they're in...Why?  these are statistical outliers).  ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people that he didn't exist"" bears some merit in this case, and I say this even as an atheist.  People too unintelligent to know they're a danger to themselves and others, or those that know and successfully hide it behind platitudes and lip-service that sounds good to a casual observer...

We propose that an adult woman, with voting rights, a driver's license, an education, and physical and mental maturity doesn't have to have the birds and the bees explained to her by the time she's hanging out with men.  If she doesn't know, why is she there?  And if she does know, why do we have to treat her like an autistic case, a retarded person, or a person suffering from dementia by assuming she doesn't understand *basic things* adults ought to know?  It takes a serious case of sexism to presume that a woman who has had multiple sex partners, knows how to flirt, goes on dates unchaperoned, and knows how to seduce has absolutely *no idea* what a man wants to do when she's alone with him in a private place.  Are women really *that stupid* that they can't even understand this?  And yet, this is what people like Dameron suggest when they say that women, out of their ignorance and inability to understand sexuality, can't ever be presumed to know what they are doing, and must be constantly reminded of what they are doing, to ensure they don't get hurt.

People may think that i'm a hypocrite in saying that we should oppose feminism because they have a lot of sexist and misandrist feminists in their movement, while still I still support the MRM.  First of all I don't hate feminists in the sense that I want them to be killed, hurt, raped, have their rights stripped from them or any such thing. I don't want any harm for them, or to have something bad happen to them as a form of vengeance.  But I still hate feminists nonetheless. Why? Because I feel that every single one of them, even if they didn't do any sexist thing to men or said any misandrist thing to them.   We are all humans, men and women alike, we both can be sexist and hateful, we both have sexist assholes who can infiltrate a a good movement and turn it into a hate one.  The difference between feminism and the MRM is that feminism is more than 100 years old, it appeared in the the late 19th century, but we as movement we are still relatively new compared to them.  Unlike us, they have a lot of power and influence. The most we can have is some mysogynistic assholes who spout some sexist nonsense in an Internet forum. They, in the other hand, can block laws, can pass laws, have feminist presidents in their side, have big feminists journalists, judges and professors. They can and already did a big damage to men.  They did more than just say some sexist shit in the Internet, they actually stopped us many times when we wanted to have our rights or have equality for men under the law or socially.   And despite that a lot of feminists labeled every single MRA as a mysogynist, and with us being a small movement without influence or power, we couldn't do shit.  While every single feminists defended feminism by saying the famous phrase '' those are not real feminists, real feminism is about equality'' and enforced the notion that any single one who criticize feminism is a either a mysogynist male or a woman who suffer from internalized misogyny.  They served as a shield for the feminist movement, which was a platform for misandrist and sexist cunts to hurt men and stop them from getting the equality that they wanted.  The only thing that they did is just say that feminism is a movement for equality and that those are not real feminists. Instead of actually doing something, removing those feminists from the position of power that they have, and actually reversing the damage.  But they only served as a shield, as a defense for the feminist movement, the platform that those misandrists used to fuck men up. Those misandrists who not only had a platform from where they can do the sexist shit that they wanted, they didn't had a real threat to them, since even the feminists who claim to be good didn't try to actively remove them and correct what they have done.  Those good feminists defended feminism even if it made things worse for men, because they used it to get their rights,they used men as a stepping stone to have what they want. The ''good'' feminists had their rights, the bad feminists had the vengeance that they wanted from men.   Those good feminists didn‚Äôt want to oppose those misandrists who had the power, because they wanted to preserve their movement so that they can have their rights even if it meant to have men as a stepping stone.  So good feminists, bad feminists, both for men had a role in using feminism as hate movement to fuck men up. And that's why I hate. And I don't the MRM to become like feminism. I don't want us to fall in the same mistake.
