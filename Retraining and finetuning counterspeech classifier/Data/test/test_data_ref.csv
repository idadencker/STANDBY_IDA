Language that attacks someones sex or sexual orientation is not allowed.,Antagonizing,Not Hateful,Constructive,Disagree,"Ok, this can be a long one. People may think that i'm a hypocrite in saying that we should oppose feminism because they have a lot of sexist and misandrist feminists in their movement, while still I still support the MRM.  First of all I don't hate feminists in the sense that I want them to be killed, hurt, raped, have their rights stripped from them or any such thing. I don't want any harm for them, or to have something bad happen to them as a form of vengeance.  But I still hate feminists nonetheless. Why? Because I feel that every single one of them, even if they didn't do any sexist thing to men or said any misandrist thing to them.   We are all humans, men and women alike, we both can be sexist and hateful, we both have sexist assholes who can infiltrate a a good movement and turn it into a hate one.  The difference between feminism and the MRM is that feminism is more than 100 years old, it appeared in the the late 19th century, but we as movement we are still relatively new compared to them.  Unlike us, they have a lot of power and influence. The most we can have is some mysogynistic assholes who spout some sexist nonsense in an Internet forum. They, in the other hand, can block laws, can pass laws, have feminist presidents in their side, have big feminists journalists, judges and professors. They can and already did a big damage to men.  They did more than just say some sexist shit in the Internet, they actually stopped us many times when we wanted to have our rights or have equality for men under the law or socially.   And despite that a lot of feminists labeled every single MRA as a mysogynist, and with us being a small movement without influence or power, we couldn't do shit.  While every single feminists defended feminism by saying the famous phrase '' those are not real feminists, real feminism is about equality'' and enforced the notion that any single one who criticize feminism is a either a mysogynist male or a woman who suffer from internalized misogyny.  They served as a shield for the feminist movement, which was a platform for misandrist and sexist cunts to hurt men and stop them from getting the equality that they wanted.  The only thing that they did is just say that feminism is a movement for equality and that those are not real feminists. Instead of actually doing something, removing those feminists from the position of power that they have, and actually reversing the damage.  But they only served as a shield, as a defense for the feminist movement, the platform that those misandrists used to fuck men up. Those misandrists who not only had a platform from where they can do the sexist shit that they wanted, they didn't had a real threat to them, since even the feminists who claim to be good didn't try to actively remove them and correct what they have done.  Those good feminists defended feminism even if it made things worse for men, because they used it to get their rights,they used men as a stepping stone to have what they want. The ''good'' feminists had their rights, the bad feminists had the vengeance that they wanted from men.   Those good feminists didn‚Äôt want to oppose those misandrists who had the power, because they wanted to preserve their movement so that they can have their rights even if it meant to have men as a stepping stone.  So good feminists, bad feminists, both for men had a role in using feminism as hate movement to fuck men up. And that's why I hate. And I don't the MRM to become like feminism. I don't want us to fall in the same mistake.

It's like the bullshit about ""reverse racism"" and how there is no such thing as racism against white people, because racism is a social construct, etc. which is also why men can't be sexualized. It's a retarded, usually leftist (I'm a socialist in Sweden, meaning more of a leftie myself), blame game protected by hurling out racist, mansplaining, you-name-it type accusations just to keep someone with a slightly different opinion, quiet and make them feel overly privileged and ashamed.   Just because you've been beaten up four times, and I ""only"" once, doesn't mean me getting beaten up is a non-existent problem and I should only care about yours.
