Link to my notion page 'STANDBY' containing notes on e.g. the the facebook experiment study design, formulated research questions, data dictionary explaning variables in the json files and the 'desired_data_structure.xlsl'  : https://www.notion.so/STANDBY-e7809ca5ae104139a002c415fdfbdcc8?pvs=4 

To-Do:

1.  **Apply rec-nition & A-ttack on main Danish tweet corpus**
    - ~~New folder in GitHub for this task~~
    - ~~Load parquet file into new python script~~
        - ~~data overview: what does the data contain?~~
        - ~~filter to only danish tweets~~
    - set up tmux on jupyternotebook?
    - Apply recognition and attack to full data
    - ~~Plot results:~~
        - ~~Pie-charts distributions of labels (see previous code)~~
        - ~~Development over time~~
        - Results to Tanja?
    - Save the scored dataset as csv on the o-drive
    - OBS:
        - ‚ÄòDa‚Äô is often swedish/norwegian: is that problematic?
    

1. **Creating a dataset of reference tweets to prepare for hand coding and evaluate different classifiers on**
    - New folder in GitHub for this task
    - Load scored csv file into new python script
        - filter to replied_to
        - Look into examples of attack and recognition examples: how does the classifier perform?
        - limit to approx 10.000
            - Approaches to limiting:
                - ¬º are scored 0-0 for attack-recnition; ¬º are scored 1-0 for attack-recnition, ¬º are scored 0-1 for attack-recnition, ¬º are scored 1-1 (possible that there are no/few examples that have both attack AND rec-nition labels) for attack-recnition
                - wordembeddings: based on cosine similarity for ‚Äúhad‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitik‚Äù (word2vec?, tf-idf?, others?)
    - Pull the reference tweets for all the 10.000 replies using the twitter API
        - Look into documentation for this
    - Create a subset dataset of 200 paired tweets ready for hand-coding
        - will be coded in 3 labels
    - Look into danish (and english/multilingual) classifiers relevant for pro-social
